Rearrange Tabs is a tiny Google Chrome Extension that allows users
to rearrange the position of the tabs in a window by moving them
around using keyboard shortcuts.

- To move a tab to its left, use `Alt+Shift+Left`
- To move a tab to its right, use `Alt+Shift+Right`

It's as simple as that. Here's how it looks like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1X3geKtF8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1X3geKtF8A)
