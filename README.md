![](http://i.imgur.com/BFar404.png)

Rearrange Tabs is a tiny Google Chrome Extension that allows users
to rearrange the position of the tabs in a window by moving them
around using keyboard shortcuts.

- To move a tab to its left, use `Alt+Shift+Left`
- To move a tab to its right, use `Alt+Shift+Right`

It's as simple as that.

## Features:

- Move tabs around in a window using keyboard shortcuts
- Duplicate current tab to a new window [WIP]
- Separate active tab out from the current window into a new window
using keyboard shortcuts [WIP]
